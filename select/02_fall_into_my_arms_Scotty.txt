Fall into arms
Don't forget about me
I been in the dark
Waiting for you baby
Fall into my arms
Show me all your scars
Fall into my arms
Don't be afraid to
Fall in love
Show me all your scars
Love you through your flaws
Fall into my arms
Hold me till I'm numb
Love me till I'm gone
Don't forget about me
Got a lot tell you
Disguise
Masking all these feelings
Can I lay it on you
Can you be the one to hear
Can you be the one
And I know that is hard
To put your heart on the line
I'm asking you to trust this heart of mine
It's never easy to fall
Just know that I'm here through it all
I'll put my life on the line
Just for you to
Fall into my arms
Don't be afraid to
Fall in love
Show me all your scars
Love you through your flaws
Fall into my arms
Thought we supposed to be soulmates
Girl don't forget about me
Don't understand how my problems could keep it running from us
You ain't been getting sleep
Girl I ain't either
You been in my head
But I've been MIA
And I know you staying patient
Seasons change, people change
But girl I know it ain't your fault
Wanna keep you safe with all your flaws
Memories of you is all I got oh
Fall into arms
Don't forget about me
I been in the dark
Waiting for you baby
